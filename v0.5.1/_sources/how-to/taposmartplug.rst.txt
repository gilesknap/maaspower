To use this device, first install the Tapo App on a phone, create an
account and register the device. Now install the SmartThings App and create
an account. You can now register your Tapo device as a SmartThing via 
the 2nd App.

You can now go into the SmartThings website at https://account.smartthings.com/.
On this site you will find the Device Network ID to supply in MaasPower's 
config file.

The config also requires an API Token which can be created by going to this URL:
